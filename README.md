About
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Before You Begin
LIRI will display your latest tweets. As we do not want to display your personal account, or its keys, please make an alias account and add a few tweets to it!
Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.
To retrieve the data that will power this app, you’ll need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You’ll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.
Twitter
Node-Spotify-API
Request
You’ll use Request to grab data from the OMDB API.

Submission on BCS
Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
Instructions
1.Navigate to the root of your project and run npm init -y — this will initialize a package.json file for your project. The package.json file is required for installing third party npm packages and saving their version numbers. If you fail to initialize a package.json file, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible for anyone else to run your code after cloning your project.

2.Make a .gitignore file and add the following lines to it. This will tell git not to track these files, and thus they won’t be committed to Github.

node_modules
.DS_Store
.env
1.Make a JavaScript file named keys.js.

Inside keys.js your file will look like this:

console.log(‘this is loaded’);
exports.twitter = {
  consumer_key: process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY,
  consumer_secret: process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET,
  access_token_key: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY,
  access_token_secret: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
};

exports.spotify = {
  id: process.env.SPOTIFY_ID,
  secret: process.env.SPOTIFY_SECRET
};
Next, create a file named .env, add the following to it, replacing the values with your API keys (no quotes) once you have them:
Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret

Twitter API keys

TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your-twitter-consumer-key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-twitter-consumer-secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=your-access-token-key
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-twitter-access-token-secret
This file will be used by the dotenv package to set what are known as environment variables to the global process.env object in node. These are values that are meant to be specific to the computer that node is running on, and since we are gitignoring this file, they won’t be pushed to github — keeping our API key information private. 8 If someone wanted to clone your app from github and run it themselves, they would need to supply their own .env file for it to work.
Get your Twitter API keys by following these steps:

Step One: Visit https://apps.twitter.com/app/new
Step Two: Fill out the form with dummy data. Type http://google.com in the Website input. Don’t fill out the Callback URL input. Then submit the form.
Step Three: On the next screen, click the Keys and Access Tokens tab to get your consume key and secret.
Copy and paste them into your .env file, replacing the your-twitter-consumer-key and your-twitter-consumer-secret placeholders.

Step Four: At the bottom of the page, click the Create my access token button to get your access token key and secret.
Copy the access token key and secret displayed at the bottom of the next screen. Paste them into your .env file, replacing the placeholders for your-twitter-access-token-key and your-twitter-access-token-secret.
1.Make a file called random.txt.

2.Inside of random.txt put the following in with no extra characters or white space:

movie-this,”Space Jam”
1.Make a JavaScript file named liri.js.

At the top of the liri.js file, add code to read and set any environment variables with the dotenv package:
require("dotenv").config();

Add the code required to import the keys.js file and store it in a variable.

You should then be able to access your keys information like so

  var spotify = new Spotify(keys.spotify);
  var client = new Twitter(keys.twitter);
Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

* `my-tweets`

* `spotify-this-song`

* `movie-this`

* `do-what-it-says`

What it does
Twitter
node liri.js my-tweets <insert Twitter handle>

This will show this username’s last 20 tweets and when they were created at in your terminal/bash window.

Spotify
node liri.js spotify-this-song <insert song title>

This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

Artist(s)
The song’s name
A preview link of the song from Spotify
The album that the song is from If no song is provided then your program will default to “The Sign” by Ace of Base
Movies
node liri.js movie-this <insert movie title>

This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

Title of the movie.
Year the movie came out.
IMDB Rating of the movie.
Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
Country where the movie was produced.
Language of the movie.
Plot of the movie.
Actors in the movie.
If the user doesn’t type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie ‘Mr. Nobody.’

Do What It Says
node liri.js do-what-it-says

Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI’s commands.

It should run movie-this for “Space Jam” as follows the text in random.txt.
Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.
